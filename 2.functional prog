 2D Array
Desc -> A library for reading in 2D arrays of integers, doubles, or booleans from standard input and printing them out to standard output.
I/P -> M rows, N Cols, and M * N inputs for 2D Array. Use Java Scanner Class
Logic -> create 2 dimensional array in memory to read in M rows and N cols 
O/P -> Print function to print 2 Dimensional Array. In Java use PrintWriter with OutputStreamWriter to print the output to the screen.

================

Sum of three Integer adds to ZERO
Desc -> A program with cubic running time. Read in N integers and counts the   number of triples that sum to exactly 0.
I/P -> N number of integer, and N integer input array
Logic -> Find distinct triples (i, j, k) such that a[i] + a[j] + a[k] = 0
O/P -> One Output is number of distinct triplets as well as the second output is to print the distinct triplets.

====================
Write a program Distance.java that takes two integer command-line arguments x and y and prints the Euclidean distance 
from the point (x, y) to the origin (0, 0). The formulae to calculate distance = sqrt(x*x + y*y). Use Math.power function
Write a program Quadratic.java to find the roots of the equation a*x*x + b*x + c. Since the equation is x*x, 
hence there are 2 roots. The 2 roots of the equation can be found using a formula (Note: Take a, b and c as input values)
delta = b*b - 4*a*c
Root 1 of x = (-b + sqrt(delta))/(2*a)
Root 2 of x = (-b - sqrt(delta))/(2*a)
Write a program WindChill.java that takes two double command-line arguments t and v and prints the wind chill.
Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute ab. Given the temperature t (in Fahrenheit) and the wind speed v (in miles per hour), 
the National Weather Service defines the effective temperature (the wind chill) to be:

Note: the formula is not valid if t is larger than 50 in absolute value or if v is larger than 120 or 
less than 3 (you may assume that the values you get are in that range).
